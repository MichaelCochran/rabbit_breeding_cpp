# Overview

This is a project that began its life as an assignment for school that I have gone back to improve and see if I can make perform as well as I originally would have liked for it to but I was not able at the time because of the lack of knowledge and time. It is a database that can store information regarding the breeding of rabbits. It helps to track which buck and which doe are being the most productive. By knowing which animals are most productive, you know which animals to keep breeding for the best gains.

# Relational Database

There is currently a table for information for the rabbits. This table contains the name/identier of the female and the male,date of the breeding, and important dates to be aware of.

# Useful Websites

- [SQLite](https://www.sqlitetutorial.net/)
- [TutorialsPoint](https://www.tutorialspoint.com/sqlite/sqlite_python.htm)

# Future Work

- This program could be adapted to help track other animals that could be found on a farm/homestead including goats, pigs, cows, etc.
- A GUI would make this program more appealing to most users.
- I need to add a way to edit information that is saved to the tables.
- I need to find a better way to handle the database as a whole; open, close, etc. needs to be done better.
- Suggestions/input from farmers would be considered and added if the benefit is there. This means finding a way to survey a group of "hobby" farmers and homesteaders as a start.
